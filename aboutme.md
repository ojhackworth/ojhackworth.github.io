title: About me

Hi! My name is Olivia Hackworth. I've just graduated with a master's degree in Statistics from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI. Before that, I recieved a bachelor's degree in Mathematics with concentrations in Mathematical Biology and Statistics from St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN. Um Ya Ya!

When I'm not doing statistics, you might find me knitting, baking or reading.
